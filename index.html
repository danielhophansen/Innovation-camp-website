				<h2>Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description"><p>It can cost up to 580.000 NOK per year to maintain a technologically equipped school in a developing country. Without these technologies, schools struggle accounting for enrolment and assistance. The lack of means to track these data makes it extremely difficult to assist those who fail to come to school, regardless of the reasons.</p></div>
			<div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Solution</h2>
			</div>
                        <div class="description"><p>The radio frequency identifier (RFID) integrated wristband comes at an extremely low cost, when bought in bulk the chips come at less than 2 NOK per unit, whereas the single terminal needed to track the data comes at 200.000 NOK at most, but as little as 5000 NOK as well.</p></div>

		</div>
<div class="solution">
			
                        <div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description"><p>Other technologies, for example Bluetooth, WIFI and biometric recognition, can be complicated to implement and learn how to use. They require an increased amount of infrastructure as well as teaching courses to learn how to use the technologies. This significantly reduces their range of implementation while increasing the cost.</p></div>
			<div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Solution</h2>
			</div>
                        <div class="description"><p>RFID wristbands are simple to implement and use and only require a single terminal to process the data. The students need only learn to scan their wristband near the terminal in order to track their attendance. The teachers only need to learn how to read from the terminal.</p></div>

		</div>
<div class="solution">
			
                        <div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description"><p>Certain available technologies that could match the usability of RFID suffer from range issues, for example barcodes. Barcodes require a much smaller range and they are read directionally. Additionally, you need a slightly increased amount of infrastructure to process the information.</p></div>
			<div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Solution</h2>
			</div>
                        <div class="description"><p>RFID wristbands have a range of 100 meters, which is more than enough to keep a safe distance while enabling the students to scan their chip and get their assistance tracked. Additionally, its range is non-directional, meaning that you don’t need to hold the wristband at a certain point in space and with a certain orientation in order to be read, as opposed to barcodes.</p></div>

		</div>
<div class="solution">
			
                        <div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description"><p>Implementing technologically equipped schools isn’t feasible in multitude of developing countries due to the lack of budget or overall support of the education system. When it comes to assisting with data tracking, alternatives such as the aforementioned Bluetooth, WIFI and biometric recognition fall flat whether because of range, durability, cost or logistics.</p></div>
			<div class="subtitle-one">
				<h2>Solution</h2>
			</div>
                        <div class="description"><p>The terminals can be easily charged using batteries or solar chargers. This allows for implementation virtually anywhere.</p></div>
